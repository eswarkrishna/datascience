#####Capstone Proposal

###What is the problem you want to solve?
1) Understand the impact of various facilities like Mid day Meal programme[providing food for poor students in afternoon] and sarva shiksha abhayan [providing free uniform and books to poor students] provided by government over years
2) Given the below fields like  in relation to number of schools in villages predict the literacy rate

###Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
1) Education department of states
2) District Magistrate of court


###What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
The data is taken from the www.dise.in/drc.htm
#####fields to be studied :- Schools with Playground Facility,Schools with Boundarywall,Schools with Girls' Toilet,Schools with Boys' Toilet,Schools with Drinking Water,Schools with Electricity,Elementary Enrolment by School Category,Drop out ratio, (Government) - Rural,Schools with PTR,Schools with SCR  and their impact on overall literacy rate, SC ST OBC enrollment

we will take data from 2-3 yrs only and we will use only 5 states data.


###In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
Task 1:-
------
1) Filter the data from the Excel sheet 3 yrs 5 states
2) Tidy it and clean up unnecessary data
3) Plotting and visualisations using ggplot 
Task 2:-
------
3) Correlation analysis. We will be able able to figure out the relations between features / parameters
4) Bring out patterns in the data to identify relevance of the fields

Task 3:-
-------
5) Statistical model building  on the data like regression analysis
6) you will need additional test data to build predictions and its accuracy.

###What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
1) R code for wrangling
2) Visualisations using ggplot or tableau
3) Correlation analysis and bring out patterns 
4) statistical Model design & Prediction with test data and its accuracy.
5) Data Story based on Video demo & PPT
